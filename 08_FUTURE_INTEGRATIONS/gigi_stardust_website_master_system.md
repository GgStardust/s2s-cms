●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●Gigi Stardust Website Master SystemThis document anchors the next phase of your project: the buildout of your full-spectrum personal dashboard and public-facing Codex portal at stardusttowovereignty.com. All current canvases, markdown archives, design files, and AI scaffolds will be integrated from this central command center.Scope of the Private SystemFull dashboard with "Today’s Focus" + "What do I feel drawn to today?"Node-based task recommendations: TPB, Studio, Codex, AI Agent, Home, Relational FieldTask tracker with date-based and resonance-based logicMarkdown archive as central Codex library (complete)Book + meditation storage modulesStar Love + Quantum Relationship Structuring system interfaceBG5 rhythm + authority logic integrationEmbedded AI agent (Codex-trained)Journal, prompt, and mood-tracking module (private only)Ability to upload/import custom reports and background data (e.g., BG5, relationship charts, external PDFs) to support personalized outputsScope of the Public System (Login-based)User dashboard with chart upload + activation nodesCodex overlay modules (Orbs, Constellations, Layered Relationships)Optional: unlockable Codex maps, meditations, chapter accessRelational mapping interface (Star Love system)AI assistant access (tiered)Codex glossary and energetic architecture exploration

1.○○Optional user-uploaded reports (e.g., birth chart, relationship codes, energy maps) to power personalized resonance dashboard logicCore System ComponentsCodex Core: The entire system is powered by Gigi’s Codex archive—scrolls, consulting frameworks, book fragments, meditations, energetic principles, orbs, and relationship structures. All Codex entries are Markdown-formatted for modularity, searchability, and AI agent training. User-submitted data (e.g., natal charts, uploaded reports) also feeds this spine to generate personalized outputs and daily activation routing.Activation Timeline: Node-based, transit-aligned task and project plannerRelational Constellation: Star Love layers, archetypes, frequency positionsAI Engine: Embedded GPT-based assistant trained on Markdown filesUser Input Modules: Tasks, inspirations, projects, check-insDesign System: Fully responsive, style guide–aligned (per uploaded brand guide)Active InputsFiles currently integrated and ready:TBDModule-to-Codex Mapping ChartDashboard Design Spec (Stardust to Sovereignty – V2.1)This spec reflects the visual and functional design layers that shape both the personal and public versions of the dashboard.Layout Zones (Stacked Sections)Header + Opening StatementTitle: Stardust to SovereigntySubtitle: A Dashboard of Resonance, Architecture, and Light-Coded Intelligence

●●●●●●●●Integrate AI agent interface (for Codex querying and writing support)Purpose: Give Gigi a functional daily-use system to test and evolve internallyPhase 2: Public Portal (gigistardust.com)Use feedback from Phase 1 to refine features, interactions, and navigationIntegrate login functionality, user input fields (birth chart, tasks, resonance entries)Unlock Codex maps, scroll modules, and Star Love system componentsConnect to public-facing Codex Glossary and Scroll LibraryTiered access model optionalThis phased plan ensures foundational clarity and energetic coherence before public release.
