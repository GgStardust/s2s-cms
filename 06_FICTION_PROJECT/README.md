# **THE LIVING FICTION**

This project demonstrates the fundamental principle of the S2S system: **the extraordinary is not hidden within the ordinary - the ordinary is already extraordinary**. Sausalito exists as a living Sovereign Field, and this fiction is the natural transmission from inside that system.

**The Codex is writing itself, one Sausalito moment at a time.**
