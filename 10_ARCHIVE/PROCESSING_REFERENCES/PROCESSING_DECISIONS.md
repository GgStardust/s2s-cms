# PROCESSING_DECISIONS — Stardust to Sovereignty Codex

## Purpose
This log maintains the decision audit trail for all S2S Codex processing. It documents why specific choices were made, ensures consistency across files, and preserves institutional memory for the project.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Log every significant decision** with date, rationale, and impact
2. **Cross-reference related files** when decisions affect multiple components
3. **Maintain chronological order** for decision tracking
4. **Include examples** when establishing new conventions
5. **Update this log** before implementing new processing approaches
