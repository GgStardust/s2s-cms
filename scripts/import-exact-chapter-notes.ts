- How we exist as both matter and waveform
- The electromagnetic symphony that connects all things
- Galactic intelligence and rhythmic cycles (charge-release patterns)`,

  5: `- Sovereignty as active engagement with the universal field of consciousness
- Not isolation, but deep interconnectedness
