# **🎯 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

## **Strategy: Enhance, Don't Replace**
- **Preserve existing functionality** - Don't break what Claude Code built
- **Extend current design system** - Add backend/frontend separation
- **Build on existing components** - Enhance current structure
- **Maintain current routes** - Keep existing navigation
- **Add new features gradually** - Incremental improvements

## **Design System Separation**
- **Backend CMS** - Clean, functional design for content creation
- **Frontend Website** - Celestial, mystical design for user experience
- **Shared Components** - Common elements used by both

# **⚠️ IMPORTANT GUIDELINES**

## **Working with Existing Code**
- **Don't break existing functionality** - Test everything
- **Extend, don't replace** - Build on current structure
- **Maintain backward compatibility** - Keep existing APIs
- **Document all changes** - Update existing docs
- **Test thoroughly** - Ensure nothing is broken

## **Design System Usage**
- **Use existing tokens** - Build on current system
- **Follow naming conventions** - Maintain consistency
- **Create reusable components** - Build for both systems
- **Document everything** - Keep docs updated
- **Test integration** - Ensure compatibility
