You can try to muffle my roar.  
Ruffle my edges or temper my prowl.  
You can take me out of my wild.  
Prohibit my furious, savage dance.  
But you will never burn me down.  
You do not have that power.  
For I am the white hot source of all ignition.  
I am the spawner of creation  
a fixed point in the heavens  
I'm  
a flaming star.
