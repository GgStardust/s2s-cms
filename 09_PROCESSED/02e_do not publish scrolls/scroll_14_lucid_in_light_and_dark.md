in a swirl of light and dark  
with perfect vision  
I am Lucid.  
Numb to the circumstances of this life  
common pain seeps out from the lines of my  
physical body  
I float  
until the traction of the tug  
reverberates through my being  
One eye sees out  
The other sees in  
Standing in between  
I call for focus.  
I see nothing  
I see everything   
equanimity.  
Are you here?
