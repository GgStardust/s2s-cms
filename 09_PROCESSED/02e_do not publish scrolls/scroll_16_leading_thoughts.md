Leading thoughts  
Why I’m saying no to half-baked intimacy.  
Stop\!  Going back and forth.  
Dance like you’ll never found the edge.  
Who are you? Tell me.  
I’ll always remember just enough   
To see your growth.  
Don’t tell me about my power\!  Discover it.  
One time i thought I was going to knock your teeth out with my elbow.  Then I remembered who I am  
I feel  
From the inside  
You can’t hurt me from the outside.  
I don’t give a fuck anymore.  
I’m wide open.  
Don’t collect junk....  Distractions   
Un realized potential is merely a charade.  
Why would I hold my breath for you \- a mere mortal when inhale is the divine goddess leading me to the sweetest exhale?
