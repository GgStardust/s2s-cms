**Winter Solstice**  
Dear Universe,  
I stand as ONE with all that IS.  
I ask for potency   
So that I may  
kiss the hearts of all Beings   
With each  
Word, look, tear, giggle,  
touch.  
Silence\!  
for  
good. for love.  
For good love\!  
I will be an architect   
of   
human phenomena,   
sketching the lines   
of the great vision you show US  
Into all dimensions   
across all realms  
The quiet knowing   
all at once  
A flash becomes   
A beam  
Becomes  
our light  
Human light  
   
the rush of it All  
All at once.\!   See?  
I trust all that is be-fore me now   
guide me?  
I surrender with   
joy and laughter  
Love  
Truly.   
Truly.   
Truly  
Whisper away the mysteries   
    
Dear Age of Wisdom,  
I am here to learn   
I am here to listen  
I am here to use my voice  
When it must not be silent.
