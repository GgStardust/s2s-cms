\-She stands on the inside of Life.  
yet….  
she IS  
a Woman   
of the   
Worlds  
walking  
Earth  
discovering  
intricate Lairs  
of human phenomena  
undulating   
with the   
swell of the Sea  
sinking  
as her heart breaks open  
toward the moon  
Soaring  
from cliffs that dance with  
eagles  
her back   
stretched towards the sun  
dancing through fire  
licking  
flames for  
sustenance  
merely a notion  
reality is function  
May it be subtle   
yet  
Strong  
Here is   
This Life  
exquisite  
complex  
painful   
happy  
sweet  
simple  
Versatile by   
Design  
constrictive   
only if   
boundaries   
are marked  
like that bird  
untethered  
between   
that which is above  
and  
that which is below  
She is a Woman of the Worlds  
here now  
and  
everywhere  
all at once  
the story is  
the story is   
also being  
written  
how far must you back up to   
see?
