True love comes without insecurity or fear.   
True devotion to one another comes only of its own volition and hits the heart of love like an arrow through a bull's eye.   
Where there is any sign of fear, love cannot even land, let alone grow to blossom.   
Throw yourself naked into love  
		...   
			let its blazing fires purify you...   
let go into the spirit of love and come to share an appreciation of the   
deeper,   
spiritual significance   
of life.
