# Gigi’s Random Scribbles

Release the wisdom, memories, and knowledge  
from your bones  
From your teeth  
Through sound and music  
Ancient traditions and practices  
Modern and cosmic attunement  
Bones, stones, mountains hold the history of the galaxy.

Unify through practice

Integrate human being  
Quantum being  
Cosmic being  
Galactic being  
Integrate with   
Sound music movement  
Feel the resonance

Creativity is cultivated and is a choice.  
How you show up and it is not always tied to or connected to artistic output  
Develop your creativity  
Creativity is the currency of the Cosmos

Creativity is the divine connection between the cosmos and the the human being

FIND YOUR PARADIGM it is unique to you

We are what we eat  
So, if I feast on the Galaxy \- what does that make me?  
If you feast on the Galaxy \- what does that make you?

“I’ll still be here… when you come back  
		From space  
I will Listen for you  
		At the door  
Take forever off  
		Anytime you want  
I’ll save your place  
\~The National
