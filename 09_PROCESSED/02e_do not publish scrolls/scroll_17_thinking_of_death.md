So I was thinking.. more about death.  
The death of Self is not truly the end because Self is not the final reality.  
So...  
It’s possible that IF we have more to do we either have more to do in this material world  
Or...  
It’s possible we have more to do in the spirt world through this life   
Beyond the limitations maya  
Through the limitations of consciousness   
Into unlimited unity  
Ultimate truth beauty and goodness.  
We are the trees and the trees are us.
