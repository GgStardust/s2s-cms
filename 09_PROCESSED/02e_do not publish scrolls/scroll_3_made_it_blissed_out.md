Made it   
Blissed   
The  
Fuck  
Out  
Serious activation started yesterday  
My teeth are vibrating   
I’m am   
Unknown   
I am something  
To discover   
Slowly  
Riding the wave  
Like it’s a jaguar  
Bursting out of the jungle  
And crashing   
Into the sea  
Dancing to the sonar  
Tickle of   
Whales  
As it licks the recesses of my heart  
In the galaxy of resonance.
