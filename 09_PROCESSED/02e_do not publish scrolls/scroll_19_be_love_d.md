Be Love D,   
Awaken me with the  
flame of each	  
	new Day  
Light me on Fire  
with the spark of  
	our Wisdom  
Whisper in my ear  
during the quiet pauses  
	of Chaos  
Cradle my Fullness  
In the crook of  
	the Horizon  
Place my darkness  
On the Ridge of  
	that Mountain  
Dance our Truth  
to the sweet melody of  
	creation	  
Sing to me, My beloved\!  
Hold me as I   
Inhale  
Inspiration  
Squeeze me as I  
Exhale  
Fumes of   
Exhaustion  
Fear  
Sadness  
Doubt  
Love me as I  
Roar  
Prowl  
Slither  
Bust out of the shackles  
Rolling with Grace   
or Fury\!  
Into the bright white blazing celebration   
Of All  
That IS.  
Palm to Palm.  
Walk with me  
through the Valley   
Of the Shadow of….  
	Truth in Love   
Through the Valley   
Of Devotion to…  
	Truth in Love  
Here the seeds we plant  
Grow\!  
See?  
Loosening EARTH  
The physical binds  
of  
Was or Will Be  
Beloved  
Break my heart   
Again  
With explosions of  
Ecstasy and Pain  
Trouble me once again  
I will SEE  
I do SEE  
As  
LoVE  
Multiplies.  
Beloved,  
Encircle me with   
The grace   
	of Reality  
Wash over me with the break of your swell  
And let love flow  
Over, Through and  
All Around   
WE ARE  
ONE Love   
Free to be   
everything   
or   
nothing at all.    
Everything All at Once.
