911  
But, if I'm totally honest, I wish I could forget.  
I've never been able to completely remove  
the thick smell of a burning/melting city from my nose   
or the film of it off the back of my throat   
or the rumbling of falling buildings out my chest   
the noise of the never ending sirens ringing in my ears  
I Remember  
seeing with my naked eye what most saw through a lens and a screen  
walking south   
people stepping out to the sidewalk and looking up  
the radios I gathered around all along First Avenue  
the faces of first responders pressed up against the windows of over packed vehicles  
everyone looking up  
not knowing  
I Remember   
evacuation  
the look in everyones eyes when we felt a towering building crumble  
swarms of disoriented, ash covered, one-shoed people crawling north  
pouring water into their mouths   
finally talking to my mom  
more and more buildings burning  
not knowing  
I Remember   
reading the walls with posters of missing people  
gathering around murals that went up overnight  
gasping for fresh air  
breathing through my pillow at night  
the sleep that was fought off by nightmares  
the man that picked up the piece of fruit I dropped at the market  
eye contact  
heart contact  
the sound of my roommates phone (in her locked bedroom) ringing  
when she came home 5 days later  
not knowing  
I Remember   
fight or flight  
what it felt like when I was no longer in shock  
finally getting out of the city  
my family in Long Island loving me with good food and kind hearts  
my grandma’s sister holding me as I cried (finally)  
feeling tender in my heart and vulnerable in my skin  
leaving Manhattan  
wanting to forget   
I Remembered  
for fifteen years  
slowly gaining perspective   
knowing my story is merely a footnote to the mass suffering  
wanting privacy every year when everyone else remembered   
last year when my children asked me about ‘nine eleven’  
I Share  
to remember in a different way  
to release the grip deep inside my heart  
to release the choke deep inside my throat  
to rinse my mind’s eye  
to let it out  
to gain a new perspective  
I Want  
love kindness compassion   
for myself and for everyone  
in this world  
everyday. Let’s Remember  
the victims  
the survivors  
the responders   
who suffer.  
Everyone has a story  
This is one of mine   
I want to hear yours
