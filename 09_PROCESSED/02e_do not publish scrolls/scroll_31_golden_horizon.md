Gratitude for the Lesson  
when we misplace our heart  
the lesson  
lies within the path   
We travel to  
Find it again  
As  
The path back to our heart widens  
Our  
Heart opens  
Even more  
You know the way  
You're not afraid of darkness  
You celebrate the light  
Water your roots  
Grow   
your  
Heart  
Celebrate Truth  
Celebrate the Way  
Celebrate  Light
