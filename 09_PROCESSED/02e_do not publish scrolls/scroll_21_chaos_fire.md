Ah….  
Chaos!    
It smells  
Sweet  
Savory  
Spicy  
Sour  
Singed  

Do you feel   
Sick?  
It’s Dark  
Look! Into all darkness…  
With your light.  

Breathe into the darkness  
with all that You are.  
Air for the Fire!  
Game on.  

Exhale  
Inhale  
Flames reaching  
Straight for the  
Heights  
Stretching more  
with each   
Breath.  

Walk through the dark  
Forests  
With that Fire in the palm   
of your hand.  

What do you see?  
Pillars and Statues  
Of  
Wounds and Scars  
Secrets and Shame  
Fear and Doubt  

Rip your chest open   
and   
Spin out of   
the Cycle  
Fall into the Abyss  

The blood of   
Your spilled heart   
Carries you  
like a River   
Flows  
To the Sea  

Keep your eyes open  
Flames in your palms  
ripped Bare open  
Open  

It’s ok to look now  
Leave the Cyclone.  

Disruption is our Guide  
Leading us to Power and Magic  
All Woven of basic goodness  
Only the finest  
and most exquisite   
Golden   
thread.  

Stand up  
And  
Walk  
Do it.  

Center your I.  
Show me your sky.
