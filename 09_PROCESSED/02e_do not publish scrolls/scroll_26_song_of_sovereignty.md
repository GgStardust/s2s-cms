Wintertime  
Peace and joy as  
companions in this   
blessed life?  
I drop to the floor  
In laughter  
\-a moment of bliss \-  
The ultimate.  
While,  
No thing is Permanent.    
Not you.  Not me.  Not love.   
No drug.  
Oh, but that essence...  hmmm  
Of divine source.  
It’s in all.  
Seen by some.  
Touch my forehead  
I will tell you a story.  
A drop.  
It’s not precious\!  
Though, You are-   
It is not.  
manipulation.  
escape.   
ego.   
hiding.  
joy  
peace.  
Laughter  
Breaks the barrier.  
Where is the tickle?  
Do you feel it?  
The Bypass is common.  
Go beyond ordinary\!  
Go  
Far  
Leap beyond YOU  
You tiger\!  
You black panther.  
You big ass  
Cat\!  
It’s Not personal  
Nothing is \-  look around you\!  
It has nothing to do with your indiscretions.    
The serpent feels no shame  
In the skin it  
Leaves behind.  
Open your heart  
You\!\!\!  
Open to  
Truth  
Lucid bare ass   
Truth.  
I dare you.  
I dare me.  
I dare you all.  
Fucking go\!    
We are alone.  
We are one.  
It is  
trans-personal.  
Fear bites you\!    
It draws blood.  
Suck it up.   
Experience joy in your heart let it  
Pioneer the next step\!  
Love in all ways.  
What else is there?  
I know.... so much more...  
And if you tell me,  
We are talking.  
Silence  
Cripples  
The  
Ego.
