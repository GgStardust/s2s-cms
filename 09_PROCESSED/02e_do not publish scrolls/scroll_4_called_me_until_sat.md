She called me   
Until I sat at her feet  
Then she sang to me   
Until her crescendo filled my heart  
I laid down and wept   
She dripped down my cheeks  
and whispered   
I am everywhere all the time   
Then I giggled a love song  
She called to me through the night  
Until I nestled at her feet  
at dawn  
Her serenade  
Swelled to a crescendo deep within my heart  
I lay down and wept  
As she trickled down my cheeks  
and murmured  
"I am everywhere, always."  
Then I giggled  a love song  
She called to me through the night  
Until I nestled at her feet at dawn’s first light  
Her serenade crescendoed deep within my heart   
I laid down and wept in ecstatic surrender.  
As she painted her salty trail on my cheeks   
She whispered  
“I am everywhere, always,”  
Then I giggled, a love song to the sea.
