There are two spheres.
One is fixed, timeless, tender — the field of love unconditional.
The other is circumstantial, riddled with fear and insecurity,
where choices are made, where freedom and attachment wrestle.

Both are true.
Sovereignty is to walk between these spheres,
to release fear so love may land,
to know devotion cannot be possessed,
to let fire purify,
to stand in the arrow-point clarity of love.
