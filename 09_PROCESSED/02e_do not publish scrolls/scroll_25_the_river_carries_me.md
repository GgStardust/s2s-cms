I don’t know who you are.  
I no longer have the space in my life  
Or the desire for  
Your bits n pieces  
Emotionally handicapped relationship  
Quit giving me meaningless nonsense   
Scrapes from a Buffet  
I don’t eat from.  
Show me something because right now all I see is a ghost  
A figment  
Of a washed up era 

* the past is gone

If we go there, you will not find me.  
When you are ready to   
Respect and Honor me as a Human Being  
With transparency, open communication,  
Mutual interest and respect.  
.  
Pick up the phone and call me.
