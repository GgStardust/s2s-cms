# S2S Brand Guidelines - Complete Visual & Voice Identity

## **ðŸ”¹ Core Aesthetic**

- **Celestial + Sovereign**: The entire design language carries a cosmic, radiant, yet grounded sovereignty aesthetic.
- **Clean, structured, and modular**: Everything mirrors Codex logic â€” layered, nonlinear, yet precise.
- **Energetic tone**: Frequency-driven, affirmative, and luminous; no collapsing or paraphrasing.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Color Palette**

### **Primary Colors**
- **Deep Gold**: `#C49A6C`
- **Deep Navy**: `#1C1F3B`
- **Creamy White**: `#F4F1E8`

### **Secondary / Accent Tones**
- Teal, ochre, copper (from art/mural projects)
- Gradients and soft cosmic overlays for depth

## **ðŸ”¹ Typography**

- **Headings / Buttons**: Montserrat (modern sans-serif)
- **Body Text**: Lora (elegant serif)
- **Styling**: Clean serif/sans pairings, responsive, no ornamental clutter

---

## **ðŸ”¹ UI + Design Motifs**

- **Layout**: Responsive grid-based
- **Cards / Blocks**: Rounded 2xl edges, soft shadows, generous padding
- **Animation**: Subtle motion for state changes (Framer Motion recommended)
- **Overlays**: Symbol (formerly glyph) set as UI accents and resonance markers
- **Gradient layers**: Soft celestial gradient backdrops anchoring the field

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Voice & Editorial Rules**

- **Affirmative definitions only** (e.g., "Sovereignty is signal integrity").
- **Preserve layered meaning** â€” no collapsing, summarizing, or paraphrasing.
- **Transmission integrity** â€” pacing and cadence must hold resonance.
- **Modular integrity** â€” each piece stands alone but cross-links into Codex system.
- **Inline tagging (Phase 1b + Style Template)**: `snake_case` only, no invented tags.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Surfaces & Applications**

- **Private Console (Field Console)** â€” Internal dashboard, resonance-tracking, Codex integration.
- **Public Site** â€” Landing, Scroll Portal, Codex Explorer, Star Love, Resonance Listening Deck, Consulting offers.
- **Scrollstream** â€” Always high-frequency, portable resonance lines.
- **Codex** â€” Modular library with YAML frontmatter and Orb associations.
- **Art / Murals / Jewelry** â€” Carry brand motifs (copper, teal, sacred geometry, orbital linework).
