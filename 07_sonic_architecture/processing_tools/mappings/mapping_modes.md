# Artist Mapping Modes v1.0

**Use these as selectable lenses in each `resonance_map`.**

## Tier 1: Track-based Analysis

1. **Orb-Aligned** – Map how a work carries specific Orb frequencies.
2. **Sonic Palette** – Instrumentation, timbre, production signatures as field carriers.
3. **Lyric Signal** – Fragment-level motifs aligned to Codex nodes.
4. **Ritual Use** – Practical deployment in sessions, meditations, or creative flow.

## Tier 2: Artist-level Mythic Mapping

5. **Mythic Thread** – Track the artist's self-mythology/cosmology through works.
6. **Chrono-Arc** – Era-based transformations relevant to Sovereign Field activation.
7. **Field Event** – Lived moments and locations that interlock with works.

## Usage Guidelines

- Select 2-3 mapping modes per resonance map
- Focus on modes that best fit the artist's work and your analysis goals
- Use evidence-based citations for each mapping
- Propose scrollstream candidates based on the analysis
